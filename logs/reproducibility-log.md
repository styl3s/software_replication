## Entries

### 2026-10-02: Notebook 0 (0-DataSourcesAnalysis.Rmd)

- Ran by: Emmanuel
- Changes made to code: none
- Errors: none
- Output: all_no_missing.csv and 0-all_no_missing.RData
- Check: compared our all_no_missing.csv with the authors' published version
- Result: REPRODUCED EXACTLY. Same 10,195 files (Hadoop 3,662, Hibernate 3,450, Umbraco 3,083), same 159 columns, every value identical.
- Notes:
    - File size differs slightly (7,861,327 vs 7,851,131 bytes) because of Windows line endings; contents are identical.
    - File counts are below Table 1 of the paper (e.g., Hadoop 3,662 vs 3,698) because files with missing data were removed in this step.

### Observations about the code

- The predictor budget (15 files per predictor) is hard-coded in 4 places across construction_functions.R and analysis_functions.R, not set once.
- The redundancy cutoff (0.9) is never written in the code; it comes from the default of the redun() function.
- The notebook asks for setwd() to a Mac path; opening the folder as an RStudio project avoids this.

### Next: Notebook 1 (1-Model_Construction.Rmd)

- Ran by: Emmanuel
- Changes made to code:
    - 2026-10-02: analysis_functions.R line 270. Changed `!is.na(refit)` to `!isTRUE(is.na(refit))`.
- Errors:
    - 2026-10-02: `Error in class_refit != "try-error" && !is.na(refit): 'length = 31' in coercion to 'logical(1)'`
    - Cause: since R 4.3, `&&` only accepts a single TRUE/FALSE. `is.na()` on a fitted model returns one value per model part (31 here). Older R silently used the first value; new R stops with an error.
    - Fix keeps the original behaviour: skip only when refit is NA (no model), otherwise continue. Results should not change.
    - Reproducibility finding: the package does not run unmodified on current R.
- Run method: rmarkdown::render("1-Model_Construction.Rmd") from the RStudio console, 2026-10-02, about 25 minutes
- Output: output/base_test_1.csv, output/base_test_2.csv, 1-Model_Construction-our-run.html, sessionInfo.txt
- Check: compared with the authors' backup outputs (base_test_1_BKP.csv, base_test_2_BKP.csv) and Table 4 of the paper

#### Result vs authors' output files
- REPRODUCED. Same metrics kept, same model formulas, same coefficients and R2 (differences around 1e-12).
- Only the bootstrap-based values differ (r2_c, slope_c, r2_c_r, slope_c_r), by up to 0.023. Cause: the code sets no random seed, so the 1,000 bootstrap samples differ on every run. Fix for our study: add set.seed() so our runs are repeatable.

#### Result vs Table 4 of the paper (optimism-reduced R2, our run, rounded)

| Project | BASE paper / ours | BSAP paper / ours | BSFC paper / ours |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hadoop | 0.33 / 0.33 | 0.35 / 0.35 | 0.37 / 0.35 |
| Hibernate | 0.21 / 0.21 | 0.23 / 0.23 | 0.28 / 0.23 |
| Umbraco | 0.09 / 0.09 | 0.18 / 0.18 | 0.09 / 0.18 |

- BASE and BSAP: REPRODUCED. Significant anti-patterns also match the paper: Hadoop (Ignoring Interrupted Exception, Log and Throw), Hibernate (Dummy Handler), Umbraco (Dummy Handler, Generic Catch).
- BSFC: NOT REPRODUCED. In our run AND in the authors' own backup file, every BSFC row is an exact copy of the BSAP row.

#### Major finding: bug in the published package
- construction_functions.R line 223, inside dataApplyReductionByModel(): `data_list = all_list_omitted_m2`
- This leftover line overwrites the function's input with the BSAP data, so the BSFC model (exception flow characteristics) is built from BSAP data.
- The published package therefore cannot produce the paper's BSFC results (RQ1 of the paper). The paper's numbers must have come from a different version of the code.
- Not yet fixed. Next: run a corrected copy (line 223 commented out) and compare BSFC with Table 4.
